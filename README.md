# How to Use
## Text Tutorial:
* Fork this repository
* Go to the `script` file
* Edit and replace the "key" text (keep the quotation marks) with your api key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). You can name it whatever. Doesn't matter. COPY THE API KEY WHEN IT POPS UP
* After you do this, click on the `RAW` button on the top right of the script.js file and copy the URL to the raw script.js file
* Paste the URL into the marked area below.
* Copy the entirety off the javascript function and create a bookmark
* Paste this into the page area and title the page anything you want.

```javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/palerbr1ck/TSPCheat/main/script.js';})();```

* Open TownsendPress and click on the newly created bookmarklet
* Enjoy!
